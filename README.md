# travel-companion-prototyper

Implement a prototype of a travel companion ap that supports following stories

User Story: Plan a Trip

As a user, I want to create a new trip by specifying the destination, start and end dates, and a list of activities or places I want to visit, so that I can organize my travel schedule efficiently.
User Story: View Trip Itinerary

As a user, I want to view my trip itinerary, including all planned activities and places, dates, and times, so that I can keep track of my travel plans.
User Story: Edit a Trip

As a user, I want to edit my trip details, including changing the destination, dates, and activities, so that I can update my plans as they evolve.
User Story: Delete a Trip

As a user, I want to delete a trip if my plans change or the trip is cancelled, so that I can keep my travel schedule current.
User Story: Add Travel Checklist

As a user, I want to create checklists for my trip, such as packing lists or things to do before departure, so that I can ensure I'm fully prepared for my travel.
User Story: Mark Checklist Items

As a user, I want to use a currency converter to understand local prices in my home currency, so that I can manage my travel budget better.
User Story: Language Phrases

As a user, I want to access a list of common phrases in the local language of my destination, so that I can communicate basic needs.
User Story: Emergency Contacts

As a user, I want to have a list of emergency contacts, including local emergency services, embassy information, and personal emergency contacts, so that I can quickly access them if needed.
User Story: Daily Weather Forecast

As a user, I want to view the daily weather forecast for my destination, so that I can plan my activities according to the weather conditions.
User Story: Share Itinerary
As a user, I want to share my trip itinerary with friends or family, so that they are informed about my travel plans.


This is a prototype but please sure you implement ALL the user stories, mocking and using dummy data when possible. We will validate the prototype by running through EVERY SINGLE user story, so we should be able to complete every single task.
